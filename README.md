  - Difference between **state variables** and **local variables**

- **Functions**
  - Writing state-changing functions
  - Read-only functions using `view`
  - Return values using `returns(type)`
  - Why Solidity is a **strongly typed** language (unlike JavaScript)

- **Data Locations**
  - `storage` vs `memory`
  - Why strings require `memory` in function parameters

---

### 🔹 Arrays, Structs & Mappings
- **Dynamic Arrays**
  - How arrays store data on-chain
  - Using `.push()` to add elements

- **Structs**
  - Creating custom data types
  - Using structs inside arrays

- **Mappings**

# Day 6 – FundMe Smart Contract (Chainlink + Gas Optimization)

Today I built a complete **FundMe Smart Contract** and interacted with it on testnet.
This was one of the most challenging and rewarding days so far.

---

**Day 6:**  — progress update shared on X: https://x.com/thenomiff/status/1998425558682898852?s=20

## What I Built

A crowdfunding-style smart contract where:
- Users can fund the contract with ETH
- A minimum contribution is enforced in **USD**
- Only the owner can withdraw funds
- ETH → USD conversion is done using **Chainlink Price Feeds**

---

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Payable Functions
- Used `payable` to allow ETH transfers
- Understood `msg.value` and how ETH is sent to contracts

### 2. Chainlink Price Feeds (Oracle Integration)
- Imported `AggregatorV3Interface`
- Fetched real-time ETH/USD price
- Converted ETH value to USD inside the contract

### 3. Minimum USD Enforcement
- Enforced a minimum funding value using on-chain price data
- Used `require()` with conversion logic

### 4. Storage Patterns
- `address[] funders` to track contributors
- `mapping(address => uint256)` to track funded amounts

### 5. Owner Pattern
- Used `immutable` owner variable
- Set owner in the constructor
- Restricted withdrawal using a custom modifier

### 6. Gas Optimization
- Used `constant` for fixed values
- Used `immutable` for owner address
- Used custom errors instead of revert strings

### 7. Withdraw Patterns
- Reset mapping and array before withdrawal
- Learned the difference between:
  - `transfer`
  - `send`
  - `call` (used recommended `call` pattern)

---

## Challenges Faced

- Tutorial was outdated (addresses, imports, setup changed)
- Faced import and license-related issues
- Chainlink library-based approach caused compiler errors
- Solved by restructuring and implementing everything in a **single file**
- Spent several hours debugging and re-reading code

---

## Outcome

- Successfully funded the contract
- Successfully withdrew ETH as the owner
- Gained real confidence after seeing on-chain value move
- Understood ~30–40% during coding, but learning depth increased significantly after review

---

## Key Takeaway

> Confusion is part of real learning.  
> Building, breaking, debugging, and adapting matters more than copying tutorials.

Small daily progress compounds.  
Day 6 complete. 🚀
